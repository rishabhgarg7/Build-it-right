## Learnings:

- I learned how React-Query library for data fetchning and mutations and the working principle behind react query: state while revalidate.
- I learned how to build good looking forms that also enhance user experience by showing loading, success and error states.
- I learned how to use external APIs like Convertkit to hit the request and to subscribe to the form.
- I learned how to set styles/classes dynamically in tailwindcss using Classnames package.
- I learned how to create API routes in nextJS that works as serverless functions(Get fired only when they're hit.)

#### Some minor learnings:

In this project, I learned about **focus-within** utility of tailwindcss. What it is? This utility is applied on parent element and it activated the focus style for parent element whenever any child element gets focussed.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
